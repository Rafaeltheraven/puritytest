            <p style="margin-top: 1em;">This is yet another adaptation of the infamous de
facto standard 500 question purity test and the newer 200 and 1000 questions
tests.  This site was created mainly as an exercise in web development and is
not much different than other versions on the web, except that those
<a href="/links.html">other sites</a>, for the most part, suck, or are
collecting demographic information about you, or are doing some other thing
that is similarly not very nice.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this version does not attempt to exploit and
profit from you, and has the advantage of <em>Running Purity Total
Technology</em>&trade;, which shows the test taker's ever-descending
score after each section of the test is completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0;">This test and related materials are adult-oriented 
in nature, though probably not nearly as damaging as the graphic violence 
that can be found on broadcast television (at least here in the U.S. where 
this site is based).  Your mileage may vary; viewer discretion is 
advised.</p>

<p>If you are feeling particularly brave, go ahead and begin the test.  If 
you're still not sure what the hell this whole thing is about, or if you need 
a refresher course on taking the purity test, scroll down and read the
<a href="#i">Instructions For Use</a> and <a href="#d">Definitions</a>.  You may 
view the original, unedited text of this test <a href="/purity.txt">here</a>.  
After taking the test, tell me what you think, or post your score for all to 
see, on the <a href="/mb.html">message board</a>.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering about things like privacy and whether or not
I'm going to keep a copy of your scores and sell them back to your
spouse, boss, parents, etc., you should know the following:  the only
information transmitted back to the server that hosts these pages is the
<em>total</em> number of yes answers and no answers, and the <em>final</em>
total score (if you choose to submit it).  Individual yes's and no's
that could be associated with specific questions are <em>not</em>
transmitted anywhere.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="i">Instructions For Use</h2>

<div class="instructions">

    <p>This is a fairly long test consisting of two hundred, five hundred,
    or one thousand questions.  It starts out tame and gets progressively
    worse (or better, depending on your viewpoint).  There are many ways of
    going about taking this test.  You can, of course, as your right,
    guaranteed by the Constitution, be anti-social and sequester yourself in
    your room and take this test all by yourself; however, we feel that the
    funnest way to utilize this test is to hold a Purity Test Party.  All you
    need is <a href="/purity.txt">one copy of the test</a>, and a bunch of
    friends.  (Lots of writing implements and paper would be useful too.)</p>

    <p>The person with the copy of the test is the test administrator;
    [s]he reads the questions aloud and everybody else writes down their
    answers.  We have no definite rules as to whether the participants
    are required to divulge their answers; that is up to the group to
    decide.  However, each person's purity score should be made common
    knowledge.  (The person with the highest score gets to be giggled
    at for the rest of his/her life.)  This works great at parties and
    lets everybody know who's easy and who isn't, so you'll know who to
    go home with.  Don't leave home without it.</p>

</div>

<hr/>

<h2 id="d">Definitions</h2>

<div class="instructions">

    <p>All questions in this test pertain to events that have happened
    to you subsequent to your weaning and babyhood/infancy.  Anything
    that may have happened before that time is considered not standing
    and void.</p>

    <p>The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating you
    AND/OR you masturbating someone else, not exclusively both at the
    same time.</p>

    <p>We would also like to define having sex in the homosexual case.
    Homosexual sex has occurred when both partners are of the same sex
    and one of the partners has an orgasm while there is some contact
    between the genitals of both partners.</p>

    <p>We would now like to bring to your attention that there is no
    passing nor failing score.  Therefore, one really shouldn't worry
    too much about getting a high score... even if you do get giggled
    at for the rest of your life.</p>

    <p class="center"><em><strong>ALL TECHNICALITIES COUNT.</strong></em></p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="l">Disclaimer Of Liability</h2>

<div class="instructions">

    <p>The user of this test acknowledges that sex is a hazardous sport;
    that a person must copulate in control, and use good judgement at
    all times; that partners' conditions vary constantly and are greatly
    affected by weather changes and previous use; and that dirty sheets,
    variations in terrain and bed surfaces, spouses/pimps/managers,
    forest growth, rocks and debris, clothed obstacles, and many other
    natural and man-made obstacles and hazards, including other users
    and customers, exist throughout the bedroom area.  Personal managers
    (pimps/spouses) and sado-masochistic operations and equipment are
    constantly in use and may be hazardous to those not copulating in
    control.  Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting in
    injury can happen at any time, even to those copulating in control
    with proper sexual equipment.  Inherent risks are part of the sport
    and may exist within your partner.  As a condition of being
    permitted to use the facilities of your partner, the user of this
    test agrees to copulate in control and within the limits of his/her
    ability, and further acknowledges and accepts these hazards,
    dangers, and risks and assumes the risk of injury or loss to person
    or damage to property which might result from use of the partner's
    facilities.</p>

    <p>As a further condition of being permitted to use the facilities
    of your partner, the customer understands and agrees that:</p>

    <ol>

        <li>In the event of a transfer of use by another or anything
        else in the management's opinion is misconduct, misuse, kinky,
        impotence, or nuisance, this service may be revoked without
        refund.</li>

        <li>The partner is the property of the harem and, upon request,
        [s]he must be presented to any authorized representative of the
        pimp/spouse.</li>

        <li>Sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times when
        you are in any bedroom and when approaching the bed to
        copulate.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Your sexual partner is not transferable; see Theft of Services,
    V.S.A., sections 2581 and 2582.</p>
