<p>There were many other sites offering the/a/one-of-the purity test[s] before
this one came along, they just all had a tendency to suck (with one
exception).  What follows is a list of the five most notable out of the
lot of 'em, in descending order of greatness (or ascending order of
loathsomeness, whichever you prefer).</font></p></p>

<hr/>

<ul>

    <li><strong><a target="_top" href="http://www.nmt.edu/~kscott/purity/">K. Scott's version, 500 questions</a></strong><br/>

    The first form-based version of the 500 question test to hit the
    'net (circa '95).  K. Scott never succumbed to the evils of ad banners,
    choosing instead to use his powers only for the good of all humankind.
    Probably the most important contribution to the web until goatse.cx arrived,
    and the site that prompted me to try to do it better.</li>

    <li><strong><a href="http://www.armory.com/tests/500.html">armory.com's version, 500 questions</a></strong><br/>

    The original 500 question test, but with the original authors'
    information and test history removed.  All of the questions are stuffed
    onto one page, and the questions do not explicitly require "no" answers,
    thus increasing the chances of user error.</li>

    <li><strong><a href="http://test.thespark.com/puritytest/">TheSpark.com's version, 100 questions</a></strong><br/>

    The original test munged up and reduced to 100 questions.  Advertising
    banners and banal clipart.</li>

    <li><strong><a href="http://www.thepuritytest.com/puritytest.html">thepuritytest.com, 100 questions</a></strong><br/>

    Another ripoff--more lame ads and ad banners.  Test loosely based
    on the 500 question original.  Could be useful if you want to Get A FREE 30
    Minute Phone Card or Get Your Favorite Music And Save $5 On Your $10 Order
    while you take a purity test, though.</li>

<!-- b nice plz :-(
    <li><strong><a href="http://www.puritytest.com/">puritytest.com, 400 questions</a></strong><br />

    For this site, some jerks have hacked up the original purity test,
    have given no credit to its forefathers, and are now not only
    <a href="http://www.puritytest.com/webmasters/index.cfm">making money</a>
    off of it, but are also blatantly collecting demographic information right
    on the front page!  Argh!  Upon completion of the test, you're also treated
    to a page full of lame sex ad banners.  For some reason, I don't think I'd
    be comfortable knowing that I'd submitted my age, sexual preference, and
    <em>email address</em> to these guys once I realized that they could be
    tracking my responses to each of the questions...</li>
