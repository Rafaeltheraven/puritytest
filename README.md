# PurityTest

This is an Open-Source mirror of the original [www.puritytest.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20230814000147/http://www.puritytest.net/) website with all stat tracking removed and some added javascript such that it works on any static web host. This does sadly mean that the message board functionality doesn't work and you can not submit your scores. The rest of this website is left unchanged for posterity.

While this is a specifically static version, a re-implementation is in the works to bring back the message board functionality, but it will require a PHP runtime.
